## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Building and Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

#### Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
The simplest and most reliable method is to deploy directly from your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Build the application
CI=false npm run build

# 2. Deploy directly to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

This approach bypasses GitHub Actions entirely and deploys directly from your local machine, which is faster and avoids any potential issues with the GitHub Actions environment.

### Code Quality
This project uses ESLint to maintain code quality. The build process treats warnings as errors, ensuring clean code in production.

```bash
# Run ESLint
npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx src/
```
