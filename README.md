## 🛠️ Development

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Building and Deployment
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
npm run firebase-deploy

#Deploy Locally (Recommended)
This is the simplest and most reliable method:

1. Make your code changes
2. Build the application:
bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
CI=false npm run build

3. Deploy directly to Firebase:
bash
CopyInsert in Terminal
firebase deploy --only hosting

This approach bypasses GitHub Actions entirely and deploys directly from your local machine, which is faster and avoids any potential issues with the GitHub Actions environment.




```

### Code Quality
This project uses ESLint to maintain code quality. The build process treats warnings as errors, ensuring clean code in production.

```bash
# Run ESLint
npx eslint --ext .js,.jsx src/
```
